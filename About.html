    <h1 class="justify">About Me</h1>
    <p class= "p-3 mb-2 bg-info text-white"><em>
My name is Chisom Juliet Oranebo, and I am based in Manchester, United Kingdom. I graduated with <b>distinction</b> from the University of Salford, where I did my <b>Masters in Data Science.</b>
         I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented data scientist seeking an opportunity to apply my strong analytical skills and knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
         I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team and gain hands-on experience solving real-world data problems. Committed to driving data-informed decisions and delivering measurable results. I help companies achieve their business goals using data insights.</em></p>
          <p class= "p-3 mb-2 bg-info text-white"><em> Before coming to study in the UK, I did my degree in Agricultural economics at the University of Benin, graduated with a first class, and got a job with Interswitch Group, a Fin-Tech Company based in Lagos, Nigeria.
          I worked as a service operation executive in the fraud and dispute team and was promoted twice in 2 years, after which I was moved to the application implementation team, where I support customers on application issue resolution and updates. </em></p>
          <p class= "p-3 mb-2 bg-info text-white"><em>  I developed an interest in Data science during my work experience as I worked with management to collect and analyze transaction data to enable them to make informed decisions.
          These datasets I championed helped the company reduce its financial loss of over 25 million naira and implement processes to improve some team tasks to help mitigate future losses. Hence, I decided to do further studies in Data science to enable me to offer more solutions using data insights on an advanced level. I love collaborating with goal-oriented teams to help bring solutions to their business needs</em></p>
